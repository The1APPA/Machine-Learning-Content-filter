This project provides a simple local machine-learning API for filtering product reviews before they are posted on a website. The system checks each submitted review using three methods: a profanity filter, a safe-versus-unsafe content classifier, and a bot-versus-human review classifier. If the review contains profanity, unsafe language, or appears to be generated by a bot, the API returns a message stating that the review is inappropriate. If it passes all checks, the review is approved.

To Run:
1) open local web page named "product_review ML Algorithim.html" 
2) run "uvicorn server_local_ml:app --reload"
3) post a review on the webpage
